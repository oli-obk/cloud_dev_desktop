This repository contains the relevant scripts and files to set up a cloud dev desktop
that allows any user with keys in their github keyring to login without additional setup.

Run `setup_login_scheme.sh` once on the server. Running it twice will have adverse effects,
so make sure to only do it on a clean machine.
